```


## Step 1: Downloading and writing to data frame the orginal data showing all the english words.

Source: http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/wordlist/wordsEn.txt


```{r en_words, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE)
en_words <- read_tsv(args[1], col_names="Words")
```


### The table below shows the first 100 words.

```{r table_words, warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(en_words, n=100))
```


## Step 2: Length of each word was calculated. Then, the number of words that started with each letter in the alphabet was counted.

```{r en_words_length, warning=FALSE}
word_length <- data.frame(apply(en_words, 1, nchar)); colnames(word_length) <- c("Length"); rownames(word_length) <- NULL

en_words$start <- data.frame(do.call('rbind', strsplit(en_words$Words,'',fixed=TRUE)))[,1]
word_starts <- en_words %>% group_by(start) %>% count()

```


### Below are the word lengths of the first 100 words.

```{r table_length, warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(word_length, n=100))

```



### Below is the number of words that starts with each letter of the alphabet.

```{r table_starts, warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(word_starts)

```


## Step 3: Drawing graphs - a histogram of the distribution of the lengths of the English words and a bar graph showing the number of words that started with each letter in the alphabet.

### What we notice in the graph below is that words that start with "d" and "s" are the greatest in number.
