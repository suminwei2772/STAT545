## Introduction   

Hi, My name is Lisa Wei. I am currently a graduate student in the UBC Bioinformatics Training Program. I am working in [Dr. Marco Marra's group](http://www.bcgsc.ca/faculty/mmarra) in the area of single cell genomics. 

Here are 2 cool tSNE plots showing 2-dimensional representations of transcriptome profiles of single cells. The graphs describe how similar each cell is to other cells that were profiled:

Please view my [LinkedIn profile](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/lisa-wei-7806a373) for a more detailed description of my background and education during my undergrad.

I hope the STAT545/547 course will teach me more skills in programming in R and how to design good code.

  + [hw07_make.md](/hw07/hw07_make.md): is the final report which shows the distribution of word lengths and the number of words that start with each letter in the alphabet.
  
 
* Homework 8 (November 21, 2017)

	Created a Shiny app deployed here: https://suminwei.shinyapps.io/gapminder_shiny_app_on_git/
	+ [README.md for hw08](/hw08/README.md)

* Homework 9 (November 21, 2017): Building an R package 

	+ [Reflections](/hw09/reflections_powers_Rpackage.md) located in hw09 of current repo `STAT545-547-hw-Wei_Lisa`.

	+ I made a separate repository for the package I made named `powers` (building on what was done in class). The powers package can be found [here](https://github.com/suminwei2772/powers).

	Relevant files are listed below.

	+ [README.md](https://github.com/suminwei2772/powers/blob/master/README.md) contains summary of the package (includes installation instructions)

	+ [Vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/suminwei2772/powers/blob/master/inst/doc/my_vignette.html) contains in-depth explanations
