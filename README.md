# STAT545

Hi, this is Lisa Wei's repository. I am currently a graduate student in the UBC Bioinformatics Training Program. I am working in Dr. Marco Marra's group in the area of single cell genomics. Please view my [LinkedIn profile](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/lisa-wei-7806a373) for a more detailed description of my background and education.


I hope the STAT545/547 course will teach me more skills in programming in R and how to design good code.
