# STAT545

## Introduction   

Hi, My name is Lisa Wei. I am currently a graduate student in the UBC Bioinformatics Training Program. I am working in [Dr. Marco Marra's group](http://www.bcgsc.ca/faculty/mmarra) in the area of single cell genomics. Please view my [LinkedIn profile](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/lisa-wei-7806a373) for a more detailed description of my background and education.

I hope the STAT545/547 course will teach me more skills in programming in R and how to design good code.

## Course Material

Below are **links** to my reponses for weekly homework assignments:

* Homework 1 (Sept 19, 2017) 
[Exploring the gapminder dataset](gapminder_hw01.md)

## Description of how this README.md file was written

##### Include a description of how you got the changes into README.md on GitHub.

I looked at the [R Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) to find out how to incorporate Markdown syntax into my file. Specifically, I included links, made certain words bold, put in section headers, and added bullet points.
1. Links are made by putting square brackets around the word(s) you want the viewer to click on to go to the link, followed immediately by the website address in brackets.
2. Section headers are made by putting one or more hash signs followed by the section header's name. There are different header levels. Level 1 headers has only 1 hash sign at the beginning, and with subsequent levels one adds on 1 extra hash sign every time.
3. Bullets were put in by putting in a start * sign.
4. Itallics were put in by putting 2 start signs ** on either side of the word.


##### Did you edit in the browser at github.com?

I set up the repository and initiated the new repo with a REAME.md file on Github. Also, when I need to delete a file, I usually do it on Github rather than remotely since I found it screws up the pushing and pulling. I tried to delete and rename files remotely and pulling, but there were errors that came up. So I ended up having to start a completely new project.

##### Did you pull, edit locally, save, commit, push to github.com?

For most of the time, especially for the gapminder_hw01.Rmd file and README.md, I editted locally, saved, commited and pushed to Github. Each time I made sure to add comments when I made the commit to describe what changes were made.

##### How did it all work for the R Markdown document?
