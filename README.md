# STAT545

## Introduction  

Hi, My name is Lisa Wei. I am currently a graduate student in the UBC Bioinformatics Training Program. I am working in [Dr. Marco Marra's group](http://www.bcgsc.ca/faculty/mmarra) in the area of single cell genomics. Please view my [LinkedIn profile](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/lisa-wei-7806a373) for a more detailed description of my background and education.

I hope the STAT545/547 course will teach me more skills in programming in R and how to design good code.

## Course Material

Below are **links** to my reponses for weekly homework assignments:

* Homework 1 (Sept 19, 2017)

## Description of how this README.md file was written
I looked at the [R Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) to find out how to incorporate Markdown syntax into my file. Specifically, I included links, made certain words bold, and put in section headers.
1. Links are made by putting square brackets around the word(s) you want the viewer to click on to go to the link, followed immediately by the website address in brackets.
2. Section headers are made by putting one or more hash signs followed by the section header's name. There are different header levels. Level 1 headers has only 1 hash sign at the beginning, and with subsequent levels one adds on 1 extra hash sign every time.
3. Bullets were put in by putting in a start * sign.
4. Itallics were put in by putting 2 start signs ** on either side of the word.
