# STAT545

Hi, this is Lisa Wei's repository. I am currently a graduate student in the UBC Bioinformatics Training Program. I am working in Dr. Marco Marra's group in the area of single cell genomics. 

I hope the STAT545/547 course will teach me more skills in programming in R and how to design good code.
