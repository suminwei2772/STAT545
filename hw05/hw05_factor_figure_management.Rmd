## Task 1: Factor management

### Singer version:
Factorise. Transform some of the variable in the singer_locations dataframe into factors: pay attention at what levels you introduce and their order. Try and consider the difference between the base R as.factor and the forcats-provided functions.

```{r singer_factor, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

data("singer_locations")

#track_id and title are originally of type "character"
typeof(singer::singer_locations$track_id)
typeof(singer::singer_locations$title)

## transform into factor
sl <- singer_locations %>% mutate(artist_name_factor = as_factor(artist_name), title_factor = as_factor(title))   ### as_factor() is safer
glimpse(sl)

## can't convert "integer" to "factor"
# as_factor(sl$year) outputs an error

head(sl$artist_name_factor)
head(sl$title_factor)
```


### Drop 0. 
Filter the singer_locations data to remove observations associated with the incorrect input year 0. Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and levels; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.


```{r drop0, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

sl_year0_dropped <- sl %>% 
  mutate(year_drop0 = ifelse(year==0,"drop0",year))  %>% filter(year_drop0!="drop0")

## number of instances of year==0 is 100
sl %>% 
  mutate(year_drop0 = ifelse(year==0,"drop0",year))  %>% filter(year_drop0=="drop0") %>% count()

glimpse(sl_year0_dropped)

## before filtering year==0
dim(sl)

## after filtering year==0
dim(sl_year0_dropped)
```

#### Dropping unused factor levels in a data frame

`droplevels()` operates on all the factors in a data frame or on a single factor

```{r drop_unused_levels, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped <- sl_year0_dropped %>% 
  droplevels()

## before dropping unused artist name factor levels
nlevels(sl_year0_dropped$artist_name_factor)
## after dropping unused factor levels
nlevels(sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped$artist_name_factor)

## before dropping unused title factor levels
nlevels(sl_year0_dropped$title_factor)
## after dropping unused factor levels
nlevels(sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped$title_factor)

```



### Reorder the levels of year, artist_name or title. 
Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median.


Order artist_name_factor and artist_title_factor by the maximum duration (in descending order)

```{r}
sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped$title_factor %>% levels() %>% head()

## order according to minimum year instead of median
fct_reorder(sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped$title_factor, sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped$duration, max,.desc = TRUE) %>% 
  levels() %>% 
  head()


```


### Characterize the (derived) data before and after your factor re-leveling.

Explore the effects of arrange(). Does merely arranging the data have any effect on, say, a figure?
Explore the effects of reordering a factor and factor reordering coupled with arrange(). Especially, what effect does this have on a figure?


Re-ordering would change the order in which the points are plotted on the graph. `arrange()` would not change the order, whether or not it is used with re-ordering.


## filter data to only look at titles with duration >1000 otherwise plot is too cluttered
## using arrange() only

```{r plot1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fit.height=10}

sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped %>% 
  arrange(duration) %>% 
  filter(duration>1000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=duration,y=title_factor)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Title versus duration by arranging data based on duration") +
  ylab("Title") +
  xlab("Duration")
```

```{r plot2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fit.height=10}
sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped %>% 
  arrange(duration) %>% 
  filter(duration>1000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=duration,y=artist_name_factor)) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Artist name versus duration by arranging data based on duration") +
  ylab("Artist name") +
  xlab("Duration")
```


## using re-ordering of levels

```{r plot3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fit.height=10}

sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped %>%
  filter(duration>1000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=duration,y=fct_reorder(title_factor,duration,.desc=TRUE))) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Title (reordered based on duration) versus duration") +
  ylab("Title") +
  xlab("Duration")
```


```{r plot4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fit.height=10}
sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped %>% 
  filter(duration>1000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=duration,y=fct_reorder(artist_name_factor,duration,.desc=TRUE))) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Artist name (reordered based on duration) versus duration") +
  ylab("Artist name") +
  xlab("Duration")
```



## using re-ordering levels and arrange

```{r plot5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fit.height=10}
sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped %>% 
  arrange(duration) %>% 
  filter(duration>1000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=duration,y=fct_reorder(title_factor,duration,.desc=TRUE))) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Title versus duration by applying arrange and reordering") +
  ylab("Title") +
  xlab("Duration")
```


```{r plot6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fit.height=10}
sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped %>% 
  arrange(duration) %>% 
  filter(duration>1000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=duration,y=fct_reorder(artist_name_factor,duration,.desc=TRUE))) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Artist name versus duration by arranging and reordering") +
  ylab("Artist name") +
  xlab("Duration")

```



### File I/O

Experiment with one or more of write_csv()/read_csv() (and/or TSV friends), saveRDS()/readRDS(),  dput()/dget(). Create something new, probably by filtering or grouped-summarization of Singer or Gapminder. I highly recommend you fiddle with the factor levels, i.e. make them non-alphabetical (see previous section). Explore whether this survives the round trip of writing to file then reading back in.


```{r}
## re-order data frame by maximum duration
## summaerise by maximum duration for each unique combination of title and artist name

sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped$title_factor <- fct_reorder(sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped$title_factor, sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped$duration, max, .desc = TRUE)

duration_summary <- sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped %>% group_by(title_factor,artist_name_factor) %>% summarise(max_duration=max(duration))

readr::write_csv(duration_summary,"duration_summary.csv")
readr::read_csv("duration_summary.csv")


saveRDS(duration_summary, "duration_summary.rds")
readRDS("duration_summary.rds")

dput(duration_summary, "duration_summary-dput.txt")
duration_summary_exp_dget <- dget("duration_summary-dput.txt")
duration_summary_exp_dget

```


### Visualization design

Remake at least one figure or create a new one, in light of something you learned in the recent class meetings about visualization design and color. Maybe juxtapose your first attempt and what you obtained after some time spent working on it. Reflect on the differences. If using Gapminder, you can use the country or continent color scheme that ships with Gapminder. 


#### Data reshaping and re-ordering can make 

-Reshaping data can allow you to juxtapose multiple variables in order to compare them
-Re-ordering by year will organize the points in sequential order


#### Applying reshaping and faceting

```{r}
## without reshaping
hfd_y <- singer_locations %>% select(year, artist_hotttnesss, artist_familiarity, duration)
## applying reshaping
hfd_y_long <- hfd_y %>% gather(key = "Measure", value = "Units", duration:artist_hotttnesss)
#hfd_y_long$title_factor <- as_factor(hfd_y_long$title)

## or facet

hfd_y_long %>% 
    #filter(year>1900) %>%
    #fct_reorder(title_factor) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = Units, colour=Measure)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    facet_wrap(~Measure,scales = "free") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
    ggtitle("Artist familiarity, hotness, and song duration over time") +
    xlab("Top artist names")
    
```


#### Apply lumping to group data into 10 groups based on top artist names and reorder the top artist names factor by year

```{r lumping, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sl %>%   # fct_lummp from forcats (lump cata) into 10 groups
  mutate(top_artist_names = fct_lump(artist_name_factor, n=7)) %>%
  select(year, top_artist_names, artist_hotttnesss, artist_familiarity, duration) %>%
  gather(key = "Measure", value = "Units", duration:artist_hotttnesss) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(top_artist_names,year),y=Units, color=top_artist_names)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~Measure, scales="free") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("Artist familiarity, hotness, and song duration for top artists and other artists") +
  xlab("Top artist names and Other")
```


#### Lets get rid of the "other" group since it's not showing anything informative and just focus on the top 10 artists

```{r others_gone, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
g1 <- sl_year0_unused_levels_dropped %>%   # fct_lummp from forcats (lump cata)
  mutate(top_artist_names = fct_lump(artist_name_factor, n=7)) %>%
  select(year, top_artist_names, artist_hotttnesss, artist_familiarity, duration) %>%
  gather(key = "Measure", value = "Units", duration:artist_hotttnesss) %>%
  filter(top_artist_names != "Other") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(top_artist_names,year),y=Units, color=top_artist_names)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~Measure, scales="free") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("Artist familiarity, hotness, and song duration for top artists") +
  xlab("Top artist names")
  
g1

ggsave("g1.png", width=20, height=10, units="cm", plot=g1)

```

##### Note: It is very important to specify `plot` in `ggsave` if you have previously printed/made more than 1 plot. For instance, if I were to make another `ggplot` and assigned that to `g2`, then when I do run `ggsave` it is probably best practice to specify `plot=g2` or `plot=g1` so that there is no confusion as to which plot will be saved.



### Writing figures to file
Use ggsave() to explicitly save a plot to file. Load and embed it in your report. You can play around with various options, such as:

Arguments of ggsave(), such as width, height, resolution or text scaling.
Various graphics devices, e.g. a vector vs. raster format.
Explicit provision of the plot object p via ggsave(..., plot = p). Show a situation in which this actually matters.

Below is the plot that was generated by `ggsave()` and read back in using `![plot](g1.png)`

![plot](g1.png)



### Report your process

Reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. 

1. Reading in a `png` file: I didn't know that the code for bringing a plot in should not be part of an R code chunk. When I included `![plot](g1.png)` inside R chunks, I always ran into errors and couldn't render the Markdown file.

2. I couldn't figure out  how to convert a variable originally of type `integer` into type `factor`. For instance, for the `singer_locations` dataset, I tried to convert `year` into a factor but always ran into errors. Specfically, `as_factor(sl$year)` outputs an error. Can we usually convert numbers/integers into factors in R?
